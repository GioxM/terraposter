    - THis needs to be done in a smart way adabtable to run on every computer
- It needs to be ale to handle different resolutions
- It needs to be able to handle also more than just city maps,
    - It can also be done fiction
    - If its fiction it can look at a folder or another open source thing to look at the map and do these functions also with it.
- It can have the functions to be prescise, in providing the names of the streets to make it more authentic,
- It can higlhight the important river, main streets, etc so that they are set apart. 
    - THis can happen with asking the user questions in the terminal.
- It needs to be able to also do lands, countries, ilnads etc.
- It schould also accept coordinants
- It should also ask and provide the original names in their original forms. 
    - With all the symbols or characters that the name and the land has.
It should also have my watermark in it
- It should also remembers the distance number that i have already used for the same city and land and the theme.
It should also covers the complete image. and dont have the boarder that it has at the moment.
